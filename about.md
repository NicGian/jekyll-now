I'm a PhD fellow in Data Science at University of Pavia researching Machine Learning applied to unstructured data. In particular, my efforts focus on the rapidly evolving worlds of Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing. I'm an enthusiast consumer of Kaggle Data Science challenges and Machine learning related blogs and courses. Prior to starting my PhD, I majored in Nuclear Engineering from Polytechnic of Milan and worked as Business Analyst at Roland Berger where I developed a passion for data driven strategies and business models.

### Contact me if you want to collaborate on new projects, I'm always open to new opportunities!
