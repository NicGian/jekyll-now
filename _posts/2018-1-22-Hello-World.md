title: Hello World!
---

Hi I’m Giancarlo, a PhD student in Data Science with a passion for deep learning. I started my journey in deep learning two years ago at the beginning of my PhD and since then I had the possibility to learn, code faster and experiment thanks to many resources freely available on the web. This is great and I’m very glad for that so I decided in this first post to list the blog articles, books, libraries, websites, courses and video related to deep learning that I found most valuable. I principally work with Python on NLP and this is reflected in this list that’s more biased towards these arguments, specially for the coding part. I will gradually update this list as I find new interesting resources. Enjoy!
